The client was driverpass. They wanted to create a website allowing booking of tests and appoinments. I feel understanding the assignment i did well but laying it out in detail could have been better explained. If i could improve anything it be adding more functions to better understanding amount of times for logging in is allowed when failing your password. I tried to image everything the user wanted and keep where and how i can lay them into a organized way to make it all make sense.
